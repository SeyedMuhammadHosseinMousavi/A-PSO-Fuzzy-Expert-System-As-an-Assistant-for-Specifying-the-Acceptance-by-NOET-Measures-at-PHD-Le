# PSO Fuzzy-Expert System for PhD Candidate Evaluation

## Overview
This project implements a Fuzzy-Expert System integrated with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to automate the evaluation and decision-making process for PhD candidate admissions based on NOET (National Organization of Educational Testing) measures. The system aims to reduce human error and improve the efficiency of the decision-making process in educational settings.

## Key Concepts
### Fuzzy-Expert Systems
Fuzzy-Expert Systems are decision-making systems incorporating fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and imprecision in data. They simulate human decision-making processes and are particularly useful in scenarios where decisions are complex and not easily quantified.

### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
PSO is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle's position and velocity.

### Integration of PSO and Fuzzy Logic
In this system, PSO is used to optimize the membership functions and rule base of the fuzzy system based on historical data and expert inputs. This helps in accurately classifying candidates into 'accept', 'reject', or 'waitlist' categories based on their scores and other criteria.
